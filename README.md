# COSMA: Communication-Optimal, S-partition based, Matrix-Multiplication Algorithm

## Overview

COSMA is a parallel, high-performance, GPU-accelerated, matrix-matrix mutliplication algorithm that is communication-optimal for all combinations of matrix dimensions, number of processes and memory sizes, without the need of any parameter tuning. The key idea behind COSMA is to first derive a tight optimal sequential schedule and only then parallelize it, preserving I/O optimality between processes. This stands in contrast with the 2D and 3D algorithms, which fix process domain decomposition upfront and then map it to the matrix dimensions, which may result in asymptotically more communication. The final design of COSMA facilitates the overlap of computation and communication, ensuring speedups and applicability of modern mechanisms such as RDMA. COSMA allows to not utilize some processors in order to optimize the processor grid, which reduces the communication volume even further and increases the computation volume per processor.

COSMA got the **Best Student Paper Award** at the prestigious **Supercomputing 2019** conference in Denver, US.

COSMA alleviates the issues of current state-of-the-art algorithms, which can be summarized as follows:

- `2D (SUMMA)`: Requires manual tuning and not communication-optimal in the presence of extra memory.
- `2.5D`: Optimal for `m=n`, but inefficient for `m << n` or `n << m` and for some numbers of processes `p`.
- `Recursive (CARMA)`: Asymptotically communication-optimal for all `m, n, k, p`, but splitting always the largest dimension might lead up to `âˆš3` increase in communication volume. 
- `COSMA (this work)`: Strictly communication-optimal (not just asymptotically) for all `m, n, k, p` and memory sizes that yields the speedups by factor of up to 8.3x over the second-fastest algorithm.

In addition to being communication-optimal, this implementation is higly-optimized to reduce the memory footprint in the following sense:
- `Buffer Reuse`: all the buffers are pre-allocated and carefully reused during execution, including the buffers necessary for the communication, which reduces the total memory usage.
- `Reduced Local Data Movement`: the assignment of data blocks to processes is fully adapted to communication pattern, which minimizes the need of local data reshuffling that arise after each communication step.

The library supports both one-sided and two-sided MPI communication backends. It uses `dgemm` for the local computations, but also has a support for the `GPU` acceleration through our `Tiled-MM` library using `cublas` or `rocBLAS`.

## Features

- **ScaLAPACK API Support:** it is enough to link to COSMA, without changing the code and all `p?gemm` calls will use ScaLAPACK wrappers provided by COSMA.
- **C/Fortran Interface:** written in `C++`, but provides `C` and `Fortran` interfaces.
- **Custom Types:** fully templatized types.
- **GPU acceleration:** supports both **NVIDIA** and **AMD** GPUs.
- **Custom Data Layout Support:** natively uses its own blocked data layout of matrices, but supports arbitrary grid-like data layout of matrices.
- **Tranposition/Conjugation Support:** matrices `A` and `B` can be transposed and/or conjugated.
- **Communication and Computation Overlap:** supports overlapping of communication and computation.
- **Spack Installation:** can be built and installed with `Spack`.

## Building COSMA

See [Installation Instructions](INSTALL.md).

## COSMA Dependencies

COSMA is a CMake project and requires a recent CMake(>=3.12).

External dependencies: 

- `MPI 3`: (required)
- `BLAS`: when the problem becomes local, COSMA uses provided `?gemm` backend, which can be one of the following:
     - `Intel MKL` (default) 
     - `OpenBLAS`
     - `Cray-libsci` or `Cray-libsci_acc`
     - `CUDA`: `cublas` is used for NVIDIA GPUs
     - `ROCm`: `rocBLAS` is used for AMD GPUs
     - `custom`: user-provided BLAS API

> Some dependencies are bundled as submodules and need not be installed explicitly:
>
> - `TiledMM` - cublasXt GEMM replacement, that is also ported to AMD GPUs.
> - `grid2grid` - distributed matrix grid layout transformer.
> - `semiprof` - profiling utlility
> - `gtest_mpi` - MPI utlility wrapper over GoogleTest (unit testing library)

## Miniapps

```bash
# for CPU-only version
sbatch schedule_miniapp_on_daint_cpu.sh
# for Hybrid (CPU+GPU) version
sbatch schedule_miniapp_on_daint_gpu.sh
```
The script will use SLURM to submit a job on 10 nodes. The job will run 2 matrix
multiplications and output the time COSMA algorithm took.

### Matrix Multiplication

The project contains a miniapp that produces two random matrices `A` and `B`,
computes their product `C` with the COSMA algorithm and outputs the time of the
multiplication.

The miniapp consists of an executable `./build/miniapp/cosma-miniapp` which can
be run with the following command line (assuming we are in the root folder of
the project):

```
n_iter=1 mpirun --oversubscribe -np 4 ./build/miniapp/cosma-miniapp -m 1000 -n 1000 -k 1000 -P 4 -s pm2,sm2,pk2
```

The flags have the following meaning:

- `-m (--m_dimension)`: number of rows of matrices `A` and `C`
- `-n (--n_dimension)`: number of columns of matrices `B` and `C`
- `-k (--k_dimension)`: number of columns of matrix `A` and rows of matrix `B`
- `-P (--processors)`: number of processors (i.e. ranks)
- `-s (--steps, optional)`: string of triplets divided by comma defining the
  splitting strategy. Each triplet defines one step of the algorithm. The first
  character in the triplet defines whether it is a parallel (p) or a sequential
  (s) step. The second character defines the dimension that is splitted in this
  step. The third parameter is an integer which defines the divisor. This
  parameter can be omitted. In that case the default strategy will be used.
- `-L (--memory, optional)`: memory limit, describes how many elements at most
  each rank can own. If not set, infinite memory will be assumed and the default
  strategy will only consist of parallel steps.
- `-t (--topology, optional)`: if this flag is present, then ranks might be
  relabelled such that the ranks which communicate are physically closer to each
  other. This flag therefore determines whether the topology is
  communication-aware.

### COSMA PDGEMM Wrapper

COSMA also contains a wrapper for ScaLAPACK `pxgemm` calls which offers scalapack interface (pxgemm functions with exactly the same signatures as ScaLAPACK). Running these functions will take care of transforming the matrices between ScaLAPACK and COSMA data layout, perform the multiplication using COSMA algorithm and transform the result back to the specified ScaLAPACK data layout.

The miniapp consists of an executable `./build/miniapp/pdgemm-miniapp` which can
be run with the following command line on Piz Daint (assuming we are in the root folder of
the project):

```
OMP_NUM_THREADS=18 MKL_NUM_THREADS=18 srun -C mc -N 8 -n 16 ./build/miniapp/pdgemm-miniapp -m 1000 -n 1000 -k 1000 --block_a 128x128 --block_b 128x128 --block_c 128x128 -p 4 -q 4 --trans_a
```

The flags have the following meaning:

- `-m (--m_dim)`: number of rows of matrices `A` and `C`
- `-n (--n_dim)`: number of columns of matrices `B` and `C`
- `-k (--k_dim)`: number of columns of matrix `A` and rows of matrix `B`
- `-ba (--block_a)` (optional, default 128x128): block size for matrix A
- `-bb (--block_b)` (optional, default 128x128): block size for matrix B
- `-bc (--block_c)` (optional, default 128x128): block size for matrix C
- `-ta (--trans_a)` (optional, default: no transpose): transpose A before mutliplication
- `-tb (--trans_b)` (optional, default: no transpose): transpose B before mutliplication
- `-p (--p_row)` (optinal, default: 1): number of rows in a processor grid.
- `-q (--q_row)` (optinal, default: P): number of cols in a processor grid.

## Profiling

Use `-DCOSMA_WITH_PROFILING=ON` to instrument the code. We use the profiler, called `semiprof`, written by Benjamin Cumming (https://github.com/bcumming).

Running the miniapp locally (from the project root folder) with the following command:

```bash
mpirun --oversubscribe -np 4 ./build/miniapp/cosma-miniapp -m 1000 -n 1000 -k 1000 -P 4
```

Produces the following output from rank 0:

```
